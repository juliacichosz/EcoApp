# Design Patterns 2020/2021 - Final project

### Project description

**EcoApp** is an educational application to help people go greener every day. It was created as a semester project for the Design Patterns course at Jagiellonian University. 
There are two modes: the user can learn about ecology at home or take a test based on that knowledge. The test mode has an option to choose questions with four possible
answers and pick one of them or choose questions with a field for entering the answer.
