# Design Patterns 2020/2021 - Final project

### Project description

**EcoApp** is an educational application to help people go greener every day. It was created as a term project for the Design Patterns course at Jagiellonian University. 
There are two modes: the user can learn about ecology at home or take a test based on that knowledge. The test mode has an option to choose questions with four possible
answers and pick one of them or choose questions with a field for entering the answer. After finishing the test, there is the option to look through given answers and, if mistaken, learn which answer should have been given.
